Throughout this course, I was able to learn the fundamentals and implementaion of React, Node.js, and Google Cloud to build an interactive full-stack application.  The course progressed through creating a user interface from React components, developing a Node.js server, incorporating a MongoDB database, adding user authentication utilizing Firebase Auth, and deploying the site on Google Cloud.

With this course complete, I plan to utilize the skills I gained to add additional features to this existing project and develop other personal projects to add to my portfolio.
